        <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
        <p>After a number of years in the financial services industry, I was ready for a new challenge. Upon much self-reflection and skill-set analysis, 
                I decided to give coding a try and started messing around on CodeAcademy and Lynda.com. I was instantly hooked and decided to enroll at 
                the software development bootcamp WeCanCodeIT to accelerate the learning and career change process. I will complete the program in December 
                and look forward to expanding and incorporating my new-found knowledge to my knowledge-base and tackling real-world applications.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in central Ohio, I was drawn back after leaving twice, once for the Marines and again for graduate school. I currently live in Columbus, 
            OH with my wife Betheny, daughter Nora, and dog Chewbacca. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with friends and family, hiking, and doing home 
            improvement projects.</p>

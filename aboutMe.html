        <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
        <p>After a number of years in the financial services industry, I was ready for a new direction and new challenges. I had been hearing more and more about the increasing demand for
            software developers and the importance of learning to code; since I've always had an interest in computers, I decided to give it a shot. I started watching 
            coding videos on Lynda.com and created an account on CodeAcademy, and discovered I really enjoyed learning new things every day and seeing how it all ties
             together to create something exciting. I enrolled at the software development bootcamp WeCanCodeIT to accelerate the learning and career change process, 
             and will complete the program in December 2018. I look forward to expanding and incorporating my new-found knowledge to my skill-base and tackling real-world applications.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in central Ohio, I was twice drawn back to the area after leaving for the Marines and graduate school. I currently 
            live in Columbus with my wife Betheny, daughter Nora, and dog Chewbacca. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with friends and family, hiking, and 
            working on home improvement projects.</p>
